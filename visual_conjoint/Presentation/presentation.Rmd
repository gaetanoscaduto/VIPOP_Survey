# Theory 1/2

-   Recent research focused on content and consequences of "Political inferences from apolitical cues" (Carlson & Settle, 2022; Lee, 2021; Scaduto & Negri, 2024). These studies focused on what led people to form certain partisan or ideological expectations based on information that is **not explicitly political**.

-   Yet, these studies have often focused on political inferences performed:

    -   On **everyday partisans**
        -   But many studies also focused on politicians:, e.g.: Clifford 2020;
    -   In **absence of explicitly political information;**
    -   In an **unrealistic setting**
        -   Survey experiments based on exclusively textual information, i.e. conjoint

# Theory 2/2

-   In this work we test whether there is a role of political inferences from apolitical cues:
    -   Performed on politicians
    -   In the presence of explicitly political information
    -   In a realistic setting

This leads us to the following research questions:

-   **RQ1**: Are political inferences from apolitical cues still relevant for inferring politicians’ ideology when explicit political information, such as issue positions, is available?
-   **RQ2**: Are certain sociodemographic (gender, age, ethnicity, number of children, and occupation) or lifestyle (food and pet preferences) traits attributed to a politician perceived as associated with them being populists?

# Methods: the visual conjoint experiment

## The data collection

-   Survey fielded in Italy, France, Czech Republic, and Sweden in October 2024 (Tot N=6000).
-   In total, N=1500 individuals per country completed a CAWI questionnaire (representative sample in terms of age, gender, region and education).

# Methods: the visual conjoint experiment

## A visual conjoint approach

-   The technique we employ is an **evolution** of the classical conjoint approach.
-   The main difference is in **how the stimulus is presented**.
-   Participants see **two pictures** (forced choice design) composed by randomly extracted “visual blocks”.
-   The pictures are created to resemble realistic Instagram profiles of politicians.
-   We chose Instagram for a series of reasons.
    -   It is one of the main platforms for online political communication (Larsson, 2021).

    -   Political actors behave as “influencer politicians” (Starita & Trillò, 2022), displaying aspects of their private lives, their lifestyle choices, and their “human side” (Farkas & Bene, 2021).

    -   The visual-centered nature of the platform: natural choice to exploit this design.

```

# Conjoint experiment procedure

-   The profiles are generated through an R script employing the R package “magick” (Ooms, 2024) for image manipulation.
-   Through this script, we generated **15.000 images per country**.
    -   Computational time needed: around **4 seconds** per image
-   For every conjoint task, **two of these images** were selected at random and shown to the respondents, keeping track of the specific features of every image to perform traditional conjoint analyses.
    -   The only constraint is that the two images **should not have the same profile pictures**, for realism.
-   Every attribute is **uniformly randomized**.
    -   Exception: ethnicity. "White" 95%, "Black" 5%.
-   Every respondent performs **5 tasks**.
    -   For each task, the respondents are first asked which of the two politicians they consider **more right-wing**.

# Analyses

We are interested in showing how much each attribute level leads to inferring that someone is ideologically right-(or left-)wing.

Unfortunately, our data collection has been delayed a bit, so that led us to only have very partial results for the moment, based on the pilot interviews (N=100 per country, that we pooled here).
